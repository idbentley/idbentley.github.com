<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
Hello There!  My name is Ian, and I'm an experienced Software Developer who has turned their full attention
to the question of training the next generation of developers.
<p>
<p>
I believe information should be free, so none of my content is behind a paywall.  If you want to support me, the best way to do that is to share this site with your friends.

<h2>For Students</h2>
</p>
If you're a student, you've come to the right spot!  Tune into Ian's <a href="/weekly">weekly lectures</a> for
data structures and algorithms, tips and tricks.  Check out Ian's <a href='/topics'>topic lectures</a> for deep dives into topics related to web application
development.
</p>

<h2>Who Am I</h2>
<p>
After graduating with a M.Sc. in Computer Science, I have worked as a professional Sofware Developer for the last
ten years.  Though I loved my work as a developer, I realized that my true calling was in educating others. </p>

<h2>Upcoming</h2>
<p>
  Ian is currently developing an online course for intermediate web developers with an interest in security.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this course we will cover, in depth, the principal tenants of web application security.  You will learn
  best practices to avoid being targetted by hackers, how to find vulnerabilities in your own site, and how
  to remedy vulnerabilities once they've been found.
